# Definition of Done (DoD)

This document is a collaborative effort among team members to establish clear criteria for completing tasks. 
The DoD serves as a guide to ensure the quality and completeness of work within the team.

To meet our standards, every task should adhere to the following criteria:

- Code has been reviewed by at least one other team member.
- Functionality works as expected and acceptance criteria are met.
- Coding standards are followed.
- No critical issues are present.
- Performance is not compromised.
- Unit tests pass successfully and the code successfully builds.
- Code meets accessibility standards.
- Code is well-documented.
- README is updated with relevant information.
- API documentation is updated.
- Sensitive information is handled securely.
- Deployment process is documented.
